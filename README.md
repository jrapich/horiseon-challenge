# 01 Challenge Starter Code Refactor

## Description

- In this challenge we are given a marketing page for a generic
marketing company and asked to refactor it, make the HTML semantic for accessibility reasons, and make it more efficient.

- I learned quite a bit here with this. First I didn't exactly understand semantic HMTL, so I found a website that lists semantic tags and how they work. 
- From there it was going therough the process of refactoring the CSS, there were several things that were repeated in multiple classes, so I combined thoise things and also added comments to explain what happened.
-- Doing so helped me learn to understand what all the different classes are doing. When I first started this project I was a quite lost and didn't understand what I was reading, but sticking through it and I was able to figure out almost every bit. There are still specific CSS tags here and there i don't fully understand yet, but I am sure it will come with time.

## Usage

The github site for the deployed final webpage is located here:
[https://jrapich.github.io/horiseon-challenge/](https://jrapich.github.io/horiseon-challenge/).

My cloned and edited version of the project is located on mkmy github: [https://github.com/jrapich/horiseon-challenge](https://github.com/jrapich/horiseon-challenge).

I included the original readme file that provided the acceptance criteria and grading guidelines for this project in this repo, listed under [./01-challenge-guidelines.md](./01-challenge-guidelines.md)


## Credits

This project is an edited and refactored version of the original starter code mock website. I retrieved the source files for this project from [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram). I cloned that respitory, kept the structure of the HTML largely intact, and refactored most of the CSS. Original and work credits go to the owner of that repository.

Much of the clarification for semantic HTML elements were found here: [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).
